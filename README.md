# Nailspiration

## Overview

This is a simple tool for providing inspiration for creating new nail art. Although it was created explicitly for one person (hence the particular pet being used as the default image), it can be used by anyone!

The application makes use of the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers), the Smithsonian's [Open Access API](https://www.si.edu/OpenAccess), and web scraping to provide the necessary assets at random.

The app could relatively easily have been created without an associated backend, but this way allows for the use of a .env file with API credentials, rather than storing them in the clear. This also keeps the front end simple.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is built with React on the front end and Node.js on the backend.
